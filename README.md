# Sudoku Solver

Takes screenshot as input, solves the sudoku puzzle and displays the solution in console and also reads out the solution.

Uses brute force to solve the puzzle over many iterations. This can only solve "easy", "medium" and few "hard" difficulty puzzles. 
Need to implement backtracking or other algorithms to solve any valid sudoku.

Digit recognition is crude and is based on pixel count, so it will probably only work for as-is screenshots.
